# BetterUI

A simple mod that adds various UI improvements. Currently implemented:

#### Improved Item Sorting
Sort items alphabetically, by tier, stacks or even tags like "Scrap" or "Damage". EVEN RANDOMLY?!

Show hidden items like the hidden monsoon/drizzle items

Everything is customizable. The item sorting is HIGHLY configurable to get any type of sorting you want!
